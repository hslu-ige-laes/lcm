# Installation
- To run the lcm application, an R Environment is required
- The application has been tested with R version 3.6.3
- On windows operating systems, there are two different ways to execute the application:
  - the "portable" version, where you don't have to install any additional software
  - the "local installation" of R
- For other operating systems such as Linux and Mac OSX, you need to install R locally
- It is recommended to perform the installation on a dedicated windows laptop, which is exclusively used for this purpose and running 24/7
- R Studio (a graphical user interface) is recommended for development purposes
- Both R and R Studio are free and easy to download
