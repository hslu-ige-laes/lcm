## lcm - Low Cost Monitoring
- "lcm" is an open source based monitoring application for residential buildings.
- It fetches, stores, analyzes and visualizes IoT data.
- The focus of the analyses is on energy saving and at the same time maintaining the comfort expected today.
- Supported data sources are LoRaWAN sensors, influxDB and csv files.

### Introduction <sub><a href="#balmer2020">[1]</a></sub>
The construction of energy-efficient buildings is now state of the art in Switzerland. However, when in operation they often do not achieve the planned values. This is partly due to user behavior, which is difficult to plan. On the other hand, it is due to the fact that the technical systems in buildings are not operated optimally. As a result, even new buildings constructed according to energy labels often require significantly more energy than necessary. This is also true to an even greater extent for existing buildings. And this is the real problem if we want to achieve the goals of energy and climate policy. Around three-quarters of buildings in Switzerland were built before 1990 and in most cases do not meet today's energy requirements. There is a huge potential for efficiency gains here.
Exploiting this potential is the goal of energy-related operational optimization. Experience shows that this can save between 10 and 15 percent of energy. In practice, this is often more for owner-occupied properties and less for properties used by third parties. Of course, energy-related operational optimizations alone do not save the climate, but they do make a tangible contribution to it and, in addition, relieve the users and/or owners of unnecessary costs.

### The Software Application
This application should support and simplify energetic optimization in the living area. With the use of open-source software, a cost-effective solution is to be presented in the price-sensitive market of residential construction, which makes energy saving possible in residential construction.
