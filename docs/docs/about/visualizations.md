# Visualizations
## Used R libraries
- Visualizations are either done with [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.html), [ploty](https://plotly.com/r/) or [D3](https://d3js.org/)

<hr>

## Color palette
Most of the visualizations use the [viridis color palette R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html). It provides a color palette to make plots that are:
- printer-friendly
- perceptually uniform and
- easy to read by those with colorblindness
