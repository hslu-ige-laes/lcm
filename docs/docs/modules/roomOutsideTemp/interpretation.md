### General 
For the user of the rooms, the effectively expected room temperatures are decisive, assuming that the rooms are used as realistically as possible.<br>
For the assessment of the effectively expected room temperatures, a distinction is made between two variants: <a href="#enbau">[2]</a>

##### Rooms with window ventilation <sub><a href="#enbau">[2]</a></sub>
For rooms with pure window ventilation, the upper maximum limit curve according to SIA 180:2014 <a href="#sia180">[1, p. 24-25]</a> applies.
This curve is not limited upwards, which means that for high outside temperatures, correspondingly high room temperatures are also permissible.
For a hot summer, such as in 2015, this means that during 7 to 10 days a maximum room temperature of more than 30째C is still "standard-compliant" and thus permissible.<br><br>
Experience shows, however, that such high room temperatures are not appreciated and hardly accepted by the users.
It is therefore recommended to use the limit curve for mechanically ventilated and cooled rooms when assessing summer room temperatures.

##### Rooms with mechanical ventilation or cooling <sub><a href="#enbau">[2]</a></sub>
For heated, cooled and/or mechanically ventilated rooms the lower maximum limit curve is defined in standard SIA 180:2014 <a href="#sia180">[1, p. 24-25]</a>.<br><br>
In contrast to the limit curve for rooms with pure window ventilation, temperatures may be exceeded here.

According to standard SIA 382/1:2014 <a href="#sia382">[3]</a>, the following areas are distinguished:
- No hours above the limit value<br>
  -> Cooling not necessary
- 0 to 100 hours overrun (*)<br>
  -> cooling desired
- More than 100 hours overrun (*)<br>
  -> cooling necessary

(*) For residential buildings the limit is 400 hours.
