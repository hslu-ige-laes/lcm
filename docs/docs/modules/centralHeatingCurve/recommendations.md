### Check the setting of the heating curve
- If you notice irregularities, check that the heating curve has not been adjusted.
- The current setting should be noted in your system folder. If the entry is missing, note the current setting.

### Night time reduction <a href="#recomm_heatcompass">[1]</a>, <a href="#recomm_balmer2020">[2, p. 38]</a>
In the following some recommendations for the night time reduction. Be aware that user satisfaction and comfort is important.
- Therefore, after changing the operating times and temperatures, clarify with the users whether the reduced operating time does not lead to a loss of comfort.
- Check as well the comfort with measuring the room temperatures and humididites. 
- If there are complaints about loss of comfort, the operating time resp. temperatures can be increased again gradually.

#### Night set-back temperature
Night set-back is particularly useful for old buildings and buildings with a short service life. Often it is set on the heating controller, but does not show the expected effect and can be optimized.
The reduction outside the times-of-use should be as strong as possible so that at the beginning of the utilization phase the room temperature in the room with the strongest thermal reaction is reached again.

Check on the heating controller whether the night setback is set correctly. The following rules of thumb apply for the correct setting of the set-back temperatures:
- For buildings built or thermally insulated after 1990, the set-back temperature should be set to 18 °C.
- For buildings built before 1990, a set-back temperature of 16 °C is recommended.
- In buildings with underfloor heating, the temperature should be reduced by a maximum of 2 to 3 °C.

#### Setback times

| Type of building                             | Night operation/reduced operation                                                       |
|:---------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Residential buildings with radiators<br>     | Start 1 hour before the usual bedtime <br>End 1-1.5 hours before the usual wake-up time |
| Residential buildings with floor heating<br> | Start 3 hours before the usual bedtime <br>End 2-3 hours before the usual wake-up time  |
