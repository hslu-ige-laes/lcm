# Installation
## Requirements
- To run the lcm application, an R Environment is required
- The application has been tested with R version 3.6.3
- It is recommended to perform the installation on a dedicated windows laptop, which is exclusively used for this purpose and running 24/7
- On windows operating systems, there are two different ways to execute the application:
  - the "portable" version, where you don't have to install any additional software (this is used in the Quick Start Guide)
  - the "local installation" of R, see [Local Installation](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/about/installation/localInstallation/)
- For other operating systems such as Linux and Mac OSX or development of lcm, you need to install R always locally
  - See [Local Installation](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/about/installation/localInstallation/)
