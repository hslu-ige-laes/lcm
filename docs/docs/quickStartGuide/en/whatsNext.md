# What's next?
## Congratulations!
You have learned how to set up and use the lcm application.

Hereâ€™s what you have accomplished so far:
- Download and start the application
- Create a building hierarchy
- Add a CSV data source
- Create two data points, assign corresponding data types and connet them to rooms/flats within the building hierarchy
- Explore the first two [Modules](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/modules)

Now hopefully, everything has worked fine so far and the first analysis of some sensor data is possible.


## Next steps
### Explore more
- Explore the sample data with the modules  [Room > Temp Reduction](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/modules/roomTempReduction) and [Room > Temp vs. Hum](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/modules/roomTempHum)
- Get to know the [other modules](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/modules)
- Get more information [about the lcm application](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/about)

### Create your own application
- Create your [Building Hierarchy](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/settings/bldgHierarchy/)
- Add  [Data Sources](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/settings/dataSources/) 
- Add [LoRaWAN devices via ttn applications](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/settings/dataSources/#the-things-network-ttn-applications){:target="_blank"} to get live data of IoT sensors
- Add your own [Data Points](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/settings/dataPoints/) to explore your own data
- Configure a [Data Fetcher](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/about/installation/dataFetcher/) which collects and saves your ttn data automatically

**Have fun!**
