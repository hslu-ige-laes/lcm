### Flow limiters and water-saving fittings <a href="#inter_heatcompass">[1]</a>
Check by a short test at several connections in the house whether flow limiters are already installed.
Fill a bucket with the tap fully open and measure the time it takes to do this.
Class B or better flow limiters are installed if it takes longer to fill the bucket than:

| Content of measuring vessel      | 1 liter | 5 liters | 10 liters |
|----------------------------------|---------|----------|-----------|
| Filling time washbasin           | 8 sec.  | 38 sec.  | 75 sec.   |
| Filling time shower              | 7 sec.  | 33 sec.  | 67 sec.   |

If the bucket is full sooner, it is worth installing water-saving sanitary products.

When choosing a shower head, it is recommended to replace the existing one with an economy shower head. This can reduce water consumption by up to 50%. The energy consumption is also
noticeably lowered. Economy showers also have the advantage of a pleasant, soft water jet.

For washbasins, the installation of flow limiters or water-saving fittings is recommended. Flow limiters are cheap and highly profitable. The amortization period is on average only half a year.

When choosing showers, fittings or flow limiters, make sure that they guarantee the right flow rates: for A-class appliances, this is between 4 and 6 liters per minute for showers and washbasins. 

Pay attention to the energy label when purchasing sanitary products. This indicates economical shower heads, fittings or inserts.
