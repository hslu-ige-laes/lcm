### Data Aquisition
- Temperature in Â°C and Humidity in %rH
- hourly values desirable

### Calculations
- daily mean value for temperature and humidity
- merging the two values by day
- keep only pairs where both values are available
- calculate season out of date (for later filtering)
- calculate absolute humidity for hx diagram (depending on relative humidity, temperature and air pressure)
