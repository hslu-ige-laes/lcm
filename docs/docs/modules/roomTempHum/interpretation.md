### Interpretation
#### Temperature
- From a comfort perspective the temperature should be between 20°C in Winter and 26°C in Summer.
- Many people feel very comfortable at 21°C. In winter, however, appropriate clothing (long trousers, sweaters, socks) are then necessary.
- Consider the following rule of thumb: per degree of temperature reduction you save between 5% and 10% of heating energy, depending on the building!
- Bedrooms in well-insulated and well-ventilated buildings may well have 18°C.


#### Humidity
- From a comfort perspective the relative humidity should be between 30% and 65%.
- In extreme situations in winter, the relative humidity can fall below 30% for several days and cause health problems for sensitive people.
- Sensitive persons can suffer from feelings of dryness, irritation, conjunctivitis and skin eczema if the relative humidity is below 30% for long periods of time. 
- Lower temperatures have a negative effect on mould growth.
- The lower the temperature, the higher the relative humidity. Therefore, a relative humidity of over 50% should be avoided, especially in older and poorly insulated buildings.
- Anyone who uses a humidifier should monitor the air humidity with a hygrometer and increase it only to a maximum of 40%.

#### Absolute Humidity
- From a comfort point of view, people feel uncomfortable if the absolute humidity in the air rises above 11.5g of water per kg of air, this is called the sultriness limit ("Schwülgrenze" in German).
- This limit is visible in the hx-diagram where a vertical line cuts the comfort zone to the right at 11.5g/kg.
- Hence at all points to the right of this limit the climate feels sultry.
