# Installation
- To run the application an R environment is required.
- The application is tested with R version 3.6.3.
- On windows opearting systems there are basically two different ways to execute the application:
  - a "portable" version where you don't have to install any software
  - a "local installation" of R
- For other operating systems like linux and OSX you have to install R always locally.
- R Studio (a graphical user interface) is recommended for development.
- Both R and RStudio are free and easy to download.
