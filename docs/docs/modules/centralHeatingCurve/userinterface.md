### Visualization(s)
#### Heating Curve

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hslu-ige-laes/lcm/master/docs/assets/images/centralHeatingCurve_01.PNG" style="border:1px solid lightgrey"/>
<br>
- The x-axis represents the average outdoor temperature.
- The y-axis the supply heat temperature.
- the line represents the heating curve which can get adapted in the extended settings.
- Tooltip: Place the mouse pointer over a datapoint to get more information of a specific measurement.

### Settings
#### Basic

<br><br>

**Temperature Outside Air**
- Selection of the outside air temperature sensor.

**Temperature Supply Heating**
- Selection of the supply heat temperature sensor.

**Time Range**
- The date left is automatically the oldest timestamp and on the right side the newest.
- Narrow the time range to make comparisons.

**Visible Seasons**
- The points are colored according to the season.
- With the checkboxes the measurements of a season can be shown and hidden individually.

#### Extended
- To access the extended settings, the plus symbol in the upper right corner of the title bar must be pressed.
- Per default the extended settings tab is collapsed.

**Range Rolling Mean Temp. Outs. Air in hours**
- In order to take into account the inertia of the building and to compensate for daytime fluctuations, the heating controller often works with a moving average over a certain number of hours.
- If known, enter the real value here.

**Range Rolling Maximum Temp. Supply Heat in hours**
- The flow temperature fluctuates quite strongly, depending on whether the heating group is switched on or off. 
- In addition, the temperature rarely reaches a steady state.
- Therefore a sliding maximum value is used to try to determine useful values with simple analytical means. 

**Heat Curve Room Temperature Setpoint in Â°C**
- Heating Curve Setpoint of the romm temperature

**Heat Curve Level Correction**
- Paralell correction of the heating curve, positive values shift the curve up and negative values down

**Heat Curve Slope**
- Slope of the heating curve
