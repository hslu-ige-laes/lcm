### General 
People have very different requirements for comfort in a room. Therefore, it will never be possible to satisfy everyone completely. Rather, one must always reckon with about **5 to 10% dissatisfied people**. <a href="#balmer2020">[2]</a>

### Comfort
The comfort requirements have increased compared to the past and today, many people feel uncomfortable at 20°C <a href="#balmer2020">[2]</a>. Please consider that when looking at the left visualization which dates back to 1975 <a href="#frank1975">[3]</a>. 

- From a comfort perspective the temperature should be ** 21°C in winter**<a href="#balmer2020">[2]</a>
- Consider the following rule of thumb: **per degree of higher room temperature about 6% more heating energy is needed**. With well-insulated buildings, the value is even higher. <a href="#balmer2020">[2]</a>
- Bedrooms in well-insulated and well-ventilated buildings may well have 18°C.
- But attention, lower temperatures result in higher relative humidities and can cause mould growth. It is therefore recommended to monitor not only the room temperatures but also the room air humidity.

### Sensor placement
The placement of sensors is crucial. If the sensor is incorrectly positioned and is occasionally illuminated by direct sunlight, this is clearly visible in the measured values:

<br>

- In summer with high outside temperatures the values are in the comfort range (shading elements are lowered and prevent direct irradiation)
- On the other hand, there are outliers in winter which do not come from the heating system.

**Mounting guidelines for sensors for measuring room temperature, relative humidity and air quality** <a href="#sensorplacement">[1]</a>
- Mount sensors in rooms at a height of approx. 1.5 m and at least 50 cm away from the nearest wall or door
- Do not expose to direct sunlight
- Do not mount on outside walls
- Do not place in niches and shelves
- Avoid proximity of air currents and heat sources
- Do not cover by curtains
