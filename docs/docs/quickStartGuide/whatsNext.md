# What's next?
## Celebrate!
By completing this quick start guide you’ve learned how to set up and use the application.

Here’s what you accomplished:
- Downloaded and started the application
- Created a building hierarchy to attach later on datapoints
- Added a data source in form of a csv-file
- Created two data points
- Explored the first two modules

Cool, everything seems to work and the first analysis of the sensor data is possible. 


## Next steps
Now you are ready to...
- explore the sample data with the modules  [Room > Temp Reduction](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/modules/roomTempReduction) and [Room > Temp vs. Hum](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/modules/roomTempHum)
- create your own [Building Hierarchy](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/settings/bldgHierarchy/)
- add your own [Data Sources](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/settings/dataSources/) 
- add a [LoRaWAN device via a ttn application](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/settings/dataSources/#the-things-network-ttn-applications) to get live data of a sensor
- add your own [Data Points](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/settings/dataPoints/) to explore your own data
- get to know the [other modules](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/modules)
- configure a [Data Fetcher](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/installation/dataFetcher/) which collects and saves your IoT data automatically
- get more information [about the application](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/about)

**Have fun!**
