### Used R libraries
- Visualizations are either done with [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.html), [ploty](https://plotly.com/r/) or [D3](https://d3js.org/)

### Color palette
Most of the visualizations use the viridis R package (by Simon Garnier). It provides a color palette to make plots that are:
- printer-friendly
- perceptually uniform and
- easy to read by those with colorblindness
