### Temperature
#### too warm in winter
- Does the heating system heat too much? Set the room controller back one level. If it is still too warm after 12 hours, lower the controller by another stage. Repeat this until the temperature is correct. <a href="#besserwohnen2020">[1]</a>
- If the controller is already set at a minimum (not lower than 12°C) and it is still too warm, the adjacent rooms/apartments or internal and external loads are sufficient to cover the heat losses.

#### too warm in summer
- When the sun shines through the window, it heats up the room. Therefore: close the sun blinds or shutters during the day. The sun protection works best if it is mounted outside the window. <a href="#besserwohnen2020">[1]</a>
- Close windows during the day, then the heat stays outside. <a href="#besserwohnen2020">[1]</a>
- Open windows at night, then the cooler air can enter. <a href="#besserwohnen2020">[1]</a>
- Switch off electrical appliances and lighting, because every electrical device generates heat. <a href="#besserwohnen2020">[1]</a>

#### too cold in winter
- Is the heating running? Modern heating systems only switch on when a certain outside temperature is reached. Usually this is between 10 and 15 °C. <a href="#besserwohnen2020">[1]</a>
- Open the sun protection so that the sun can heat the room through the window. <a href="#besserwohnen2020">[1]</a>
- Are the radiators free? Anything close to a radiator hinders heat dissipation. If you move furniture, covers, curtains away from radiators, the heat can flow unhindered into the room. <a href="#besserwohnen2020">[1]</a>
- Does the room have underfloor heating? Then make sure that thick carpets do not reduce the heat emission. <a href="#besserwohnen2020">[1]</a>
- Ventilate correctly. A lot of heat is lost through constantly open tilt windows. The right way to ventilate is to open all windows in the apartment at least 3 times a day for 5 to 10 minutes and then close them again. In this way you exchange the air without cooling the room. If there is a ventilation system, minimize addidional ventilation through the windows. <a href="#besserwohnen2020">[1]</a>
- Does the heating system heat too weak? Set the controller one level higher. If it is still too cold after 12 hours, set the controller another level higher. Repeat this until the temperature is correct. <a href="#besserwohnen2020">[1]</a>
- If the heating system cannot reach the desired temperature, check the heating distribution as well as the heating itself. If necessary, the heating curve must be adjusted.
