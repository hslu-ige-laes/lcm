### Temperature
#### too warm in winter
- Does the heating system heat too much? Set the room controller back one level. If it is still too warm after 12 hours, lower the controller by another stage. Repeat this until the temperature is correct. <a href="#besserwohnen2020">[3]</a>
- If the controller is already set at a minimum (not lower than 12°C) and it is still too warm, the adjacent rooms/apartments or internal and external loads are sufficient to cover the heat losses.

#### too warm in summer
- When the sun shines through the window, it heats up the room. Therefore: close the sun blinds or shutters during the day. The sun protection works best if it is mounted outside the window. <a href="#besserwohnen2020">[3]</a>
- Close windows during the day, then the heat stays outside. <a href="#besserwohnen2020">[3]</a>
- Open windows at night, then the cooler air can enter. <a href="#besserwohnen2020">[3]</a>
- Switch off electrical appliances and lighting, because every electrical device generates heat. <a href="#besserwohnen2020">[3]</a>

#### too cold in winter
- Is the heating running? Modern heating systems only switch on when a certain outside temperature is reached. Usually this is between 10 and 15 °C. <a href="#besserwohnen2020">[3]</a>
- Open the sun protection so that the sun can heat the room through the window. <a href="#besserwohnen2020">[3]</a>
- Are the radiators free? Anything close to a radiator hinders heat dissipation. If you move furniture, covers, curtains away from radiators, the heat can flow unhindered into the room. <a href="#besserwohnen2020">[3]</a>
- Does the room have underfloor heating? Then make sure that thick carpets do not reduce the heat emission. <a href="#besserwohnen2020">[3]</a>
- Ventilate correctly. A lot of heat is lost through constantly open tilt windows. The right way to ventilate is to open all windows in the apartment at least 3 times a day for 5 to 10 minutes and then close them again. In this way you exchange the air without cooling the room. If there is a ventilation system, minimize addidional ventilation through the windows. <a href="#besserwohnen2020">[3]</a>
- Does the heating system heat too weak? Set the controller one level higher. If it is still too cold after 12 hours, set the controller another level higher. Repeat this until the temperature is correct. <a href="#besserwohnen2020">[3]</a>
- If the heating system cannot reach the desired temperature, check the heating distribution as well as the heating itself. If necessary, the heating curve must be adjusted.

### Humidity
#### too dry
Usually the room air does not need to be humidified <a href="#sia382_706">[1]</a>. But modern and well sealed buildings with mechanical ventilation may get problems in winter.

- The warmer the air in a room, the drier it becomes. Therefore, lower the room temperature. You can read how to do this in the chapter "too cold in winter" above. <a href="#besserwohnen2020">[3]</a>
- Ventilate correctly. Via constantly open tilt windows not only heat but also humidity is lost. Open all windows at least 3 times a day for 5 to 10 minutes. The lower the outside temperature, the shorter you can ventilate. In case the apartment has a ventilation system, ventilate less through the windows and set the regulator back one level. <a href="#besserwohnen2020">[3]</a>
- Plants release moisture into the air. Place a few green roommates in the living room - they provide pleasant humidity free of charge. <a href="#besserwohnen2020">[3]</a>
- Open the bathroom door after showering or bathing. Then the moisture can get into the other rooms of the apartment. <a href="#besserwohnen2020">[3]</a>
- If the relative humidity is with the above mentioned tips still below 30% for a longer period of time, the use of a humidifier may be necessary. Humidify to a maximum of 45% <a href="#balmer2020">[2]</a>

#### too humid or mouldy
- Ventilate correctly in winter. If too little ventilation is provided, moisture collects in the room air. Open all windows for 5 to 10 minutes at least 3 times a day. If the apartment has a ventilation system, increase the ventilator one step. <a href="#besserwohnen2020">[3]</a>
- Plants release moisture into the air. If you remove some of them, the air humidity will also decrease. <a href="#besserwohnen2020">[3]</a>
- Do not dry laundry in the apartment. When laundry dries, it releases moisture into the air. Therefore, dry your laundry in the drying room and not in the apartment. <a href="#besserwohnen2020">[3]</a>
