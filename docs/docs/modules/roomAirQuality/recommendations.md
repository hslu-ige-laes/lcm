### Ventilate correctly <a href="#besserwohnen2020">[1]</a>
- If too little ventilation is provided, odors accumulate in the room air.
- But do not ventilate through windows that are constantly tilted - you can lost a lot of heat.
- At least 3 times a day, fully open all windows in the apartment for 5 to 10 minutes and then close them again.
- If your apartment has a ventilation system, set the controller one level higher. 

### Check ventilation system
- Change filters
- Make air volume adjustment by a ventilation company if there is a suspicion that some rooms get too little air compared to others
- Adaptation of the timer program to current needs by reprogramming (can usually be done by customers themselves)

### Ventilation system with CO<sub>2</sub> sensor(s)
- Newer plants work demand-oriented, e.g. by means of CO<sub>2</sub> control, in order to not supply too large quantities of air, which can lead to an unnecessary drying out of the rooms.
- Such sensors can also be installed later and are available as well for residential systems.
