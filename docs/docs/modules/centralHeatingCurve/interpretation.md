### Sensor placement
- If a pipe contact sensor is used, the real temperature of the system is higher than the measured value.
- Therefore the temperatures should not be questioned here in the range of decimal places.

### Heating curve adaption <a href="#inter_balmer2020">[1, p. 37]</a>
The correct setting of the heating curve takes a lot of time because of the inertia of the building and the many influences to which it is exposed.

- Identify representative or critical spaces: North side, corner position, top floor.
- Remove thermostatic valves or open them completely. 
- If possible, measure temperature in warm (around 10 °C) and cold (below 0 °C) weather during day and night.
- Avoid exposure to external heat, e.g. from the sun, lamps or appliances during the measurements.
- The windows should remain closed.

Based on the measurement results, the heating curve will be adjusted, see <a href="#recomm_balmer2020">[1, p. 37]</a>. It will be corrected for cold and mild outdoor temperatures. The target room temperature must be defined in advance with the client. 

It must be reached in the most unfavorable room at the beginning of the usage time. If the temperature is clearly too low only in individual rooms, the problem should not be solved by increasing the heating curve. Instead, the situation there must be clarified in detail:
- Check the flow rate: Is the radiator warm over the entire surface? If it is warm at the top and cold at the bottom, the flow rate is too low.
- Check whether the valves are completely open. If the radiator is cold at the top and warm at the bottom, vent the air.
- Improve the flow around the radiators on the room side: Free radiators from obstructions by curtains, furniture and similar.
- Measure the floor temperature distribution with a thermal camera.
- If necessary, increase the flow rate or desludge floor heating pipes.
