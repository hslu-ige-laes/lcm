# Add Data Source
- In this example, we add a CSV file that stems from a datalogger
- The sample file contains temperature and humidity measurements from one room
- Later on, you can import your own CSV files as well as other data sources, e.g. LoRaWAN sensors or InfluxDB databases (see [What's next](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/quickStartGuide/whatsNext/))


1. Navigate to `Settings > Data Sources` in the sidebar
1. Click `Add new`
1. Set a user-defined `source Name`, such as `tempHumFlatA`
1. Choose the sample data file `tempHum.csv`. This file is included in your application folder in the subfolder `/sampleData`
1. Click `Add new data source`

The new CSV data source now appears in the source table.

Click "Next" in order to learn how you can add individual data points.
