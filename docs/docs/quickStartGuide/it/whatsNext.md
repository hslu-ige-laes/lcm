# What's next?
## Congratulations!
You have learned how to set up and use the lcm application.

Hereâ€™s what you have accomplished so far:
- Download and start the application
- Create a building hierarchy
- Add a CSV data source
- Create two data points, assign corresponding data types and connet them to rooms/flats within the building hierarchy
- Explor the first two [Modules](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/modules)

Now hopefully, everything has worked fine so far and the first analysis of some sensor data is possible.


## Next steps
Now you are ready to:
- Explore the sample data with the modules  [Room > Temp Reduction](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/modules/roomTempReduction) and [Room > Temp vs. Hum](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/modules/roomTempHum)
- Create your own [Building Hierarchy](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/settings/bldgHierarchy/)
- Add your own [Data Sources](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/settings/dataSources/) 
- Add [LoRaWAN devices via ttn applications](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/settings/dataSources/#the-things-network-ttn-applications) to get live data of IoT sensors
- Add your own [Data Points](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/settings/dataPoints/) to explore your own data
- Get to know the [other modules](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/modules)
- Configure a [Data Fetcher](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/installation/dataFetcher/) which collects and saves your ttn data automatically
- Get more information [about the lcm application](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/about)

**Have fun!**
