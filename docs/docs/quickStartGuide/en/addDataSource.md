# Add Data Source
- In this example, we add a CSV file that stems from a datalogger
- The sample file contains temperature and humidity measurements from one room
- Later on, you can import your own CSV files as well as other data sources, e.g. LoRaWAN sensors or InfluxDB databases


1. Navigate to `Settings > Data Sources` in the sidebar
1. Click `Add new`
1. Set a user-defined `source Name`, such as `flatTempHum`
1. Choose over the button `Browse...` the sample data file `flatTempHum.csv`. This file is included in your application folder in the subfolder `/sampleData`<br><br>
   Your window should look like this:<br>

The new CSV data source now appears in the source table:<br>
