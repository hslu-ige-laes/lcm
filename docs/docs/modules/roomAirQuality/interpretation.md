### General <a href="#nachhaltigebueros">[2]</a>
Today, CO2 is one of the most important indicators for evaluating the air quality in office buildings.
Since humans produce CO2 by breathing and release it into the air, the CO2 content in occupied, unventilated rooms increases rapidly.
With increasing CO2 concentration, room users experience odorous complaints and, with significantly increased CO2 concentration, even health problems (concentration disorders, headaches, dizziness, etc.). 

### Thresholds <a href="#nachhaltigebueros">[2]</a>
In Switzerland, the Swiss Accident Insurance Institution is generally responsible for health-related limit values at the workplace [1].
The SUVA publishes an annual report entitled "Occupational Exposure Limits", which also includes the maximum workplace concentration values (MAK values).
These are limit values that are intended to ensure health protection but not comfort: While the SUVA sets 5'000 ppm (parts per million) as MAK value for carbon dioxide, the guideline to the regulation 3 of the labor law states: "Good indoor air is given if the total concentration of 1'000 ppm CO2 is not exceeded over the period of use of the room.
