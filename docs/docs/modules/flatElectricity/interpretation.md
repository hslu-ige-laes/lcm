### Daily Consumption in kWh
- Compare the measured values with the typical household. This calculation is based on <a href="#inter_nipkov">[1]</a> and can get adapted via the extended settings. 
- To access the extended settings, the plus symbol in the upper right corner of the title bar must be pressed.
- Regardless of the result, optimization always makes sense from an energy point of view. Read the numerous energy saving tips in the recommendations tab.
- According to <a href="#inter_boogen">[3]</a>, the average savings potential for electricity in Swiss households is between 20 and 25%.

### Standby-losses
The standby calculation should be used with caution, as it also includes devices that are in operation around the clock and can run at different levels (e.g. a refrigerator). With hourly aggregation of measurement data, it is difficult to determine the effective minimum power when these devices are operating in overlapping cycles. At the expense of computing power, an analysis of 15 minutes values could be done here, if available from the data acquisition.

Nevertheless a reference band to get a feeling for the magnitude:
- A study from 2006 <a href="#inter_zehnder">[2]</a> shows that Swiss households have standby losses of between 18 Watts (1 person) and 80 Watts (4 person) watts. The Author of <a href="#inter_boogen">[3]</a> states that this reference band is higher today.
