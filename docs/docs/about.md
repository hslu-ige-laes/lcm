## General
- The app is built as a [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) web application which is based on the [programming language R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)).
- R and its web application extension [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) are a good solution to build prototypes of web apps which require data analysis and visualization functionality.
- No programming skills are required to install and use the application.
- If you want to extend or adapt the application a basic knowledge of R, [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) and the graph library [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.html) and [ploty](https://plotly.com/r/) are required.
- The nice thing with R Shiny application is, that everything is open source and no further knowledge of HTML, CSS or JavaScript is required to build small and minimal apps.

## Getting started with R, RStudio and Shiny
- [RStudio Education](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/) serves as good starting point for beginners in R and RStudio. 
- If you are only new to Shiny we suggest the free <a href="https://mastering-shiny.org/" target="_blank">"Mastering Shiny book"</a>
