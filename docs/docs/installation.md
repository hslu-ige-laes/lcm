# Installation
## Prerequisites
- To run the application an installed R environment is required. The application is tested with R version 3.6.3.
- R Studio (a graphical user interface for R) is recommended.
- Therefore you can run "lcm" on windows, linux and OSX operating systems where R is installed.
- Both R and RStudio are free and easy to download, see instructions below.
- For windows operating systems we have packed an "R Portable" solution where no installation of R is required to run the application.
