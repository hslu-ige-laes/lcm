### Reference values <a href="#inter_energiestiftung">[1]</a>
In the year **1975**, a standard new residential building in Switzerland consumed **220 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>** energy to cover its heating requirements.
Today's new buildings in Switzerland need only a fraction of this. Even more: Houses are no longer energy consumers - they are becoming energy suppliers.
Consider the following rule of thumb: **per degree of higher room temperature about 6% more heating energy is needed**. With well-insulated buildings, the value is even higher. <a href="#inter_balmer2020">[2]</a>

#### MuKEn 2008
- The model regulations of the cantons in the energy sector only allow **48 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>** of energy to cover the heating requirements of **new buildings**.
- For **comprehensively renovated houses** a maximum consumption of **90 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>** is still permitted.

#### Minergie standard (2009) - the low-energy house
- The Minergie standard for new residential buildings is based on a well-insulated building envelope, the thermal insulation is around 20 cm.
- To achieve this, the building must be airtight, thermal bridges must be avoided and the building must be equipped with comfort ventilation, ideally with heat recovery.
- The heat requirement must not exceed **38 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>**.

#### Minergie-P Standard (2009) - the lowest energy house
- The heat requirement for new residential buildings may reach a maximum of **30 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>**.

#### Minergie-A Standard (2011) - the zero-energy house
- The Minergie-A standard requires **0 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>** and year to cover the heat requirement.
- In these zero-energy houses, hot water and space heating are completely covered with renewable energy.
