# What's next?
## Celebrate!
By completing this quick start guide you’ve learned how to set up the application.

Here’s what you accomplished:
- Downloaded and Started the application
- Created a building hierarchy to attach later on datapoints
- Added a data source in form of a csv-file
- Created two data points
- Explored the first two modules

Cool, everything seems to work and the first analysis of the sensor data is possible. 


## Next steps
Now you are up and running to either
- explore the sample data with the modules  [Room > Temp Reduction](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/modules/roomTempReduction) or [Room > Temp vs. Hum](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/modules/roomTempHum) or
- adding your own data sources and data points to explore your own data and get to know the [other modules](https://hslu-ige-laes.github.io/lcm/docs/modules).

**Have fun!**
