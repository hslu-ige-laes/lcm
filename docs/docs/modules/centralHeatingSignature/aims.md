### Energy Efficiency
- Reduction of total heating energy
- Detection of irregularities
- Proof/quantification of implemented energy saving measures
- Detect bad adjustment of the heating system
- Determine effectively required heat output
- Check if heating is oversized
- Predict the development of heating energy consumption
- Calculate energy index of the building
