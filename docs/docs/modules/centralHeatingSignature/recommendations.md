### Thermostatic valves <a href="#recomm_heatcompass">[1]</a>
Thermostatic valves keep the room temperature at the desired level in all weather conditions. This increases comfort and reduces consumption by up to 20%.

If there are no thermostatic valves installed on the radiators in your building, then a retrofit is recommended.
- Thermostatic valves can also be easily retrofitted.
- The investment pays for itself after only 1 to 2 years.

#### Are the thermostatic valves on the radiators set correctly?
- Adjust the thermostatic valves to the desired set points at the beginning of the season.
- If necessary, check the function of the valve!
- The center position 3 on the thermostatic valve should correspond to a room temperature of 20 °C. If this temperature does not adjust automatically, this should be investigated.
- The settings in the following table can be used as a guide.

| Room            | Position on valve | Temperature |
|:----------------|:-------------------------------------:|:-----------:|
| Living room     | 3                                     | 20°C        |
| Bedroom         | 2                                     | 17°C        |
| Play/hobby room | 2-3                                   | 17-20°C     |
| Bath/toilet     | 3-4                                   | 20-23°C     |
| Corridor        | 2                                     | 17°C        |
| Office          | 3                                     | 20°C        |
| unused room     | *                                     | -           |
 
### Energy saving tips heating for room users <a href="#recomm_heatcompass">[1]</a>
#### Ensure unhindered heat emission
- Do not place furniture in front of the radiators

#### Avoid curtains in front of the radiators
- Do not use the radiators as storage space

#### Ventilate briefly and vigorously
- Avoid constantly open windows (e.g. bottom hung windows).
- Instead, ventilate 3 times a day for 5-10 minutes by cross-ventilation (open several windows at the same time)

#### Also save at night
- Close the shutters and windows at night if possible.
- If you sleep with the window open, always set the thermostatic valves to the anti-freeze position (position *)

#### Use the thermostatic valves
- Every degree more room temperature increases energy consumption by ca. 6%.
- If you are absent for more than two days, turn the thermostatic valves one step back (e.g. from pos. 3 to 2).
- In rooms that are rarely used, such as guest rooms, set the thermostatic valves to position 1-2. If this causes condensation to form on the windows, increase the setting.

#### Contact your janitor
- Inform the janitor not only when you are too cold, but also when you are too warm.
- Let him know if there is an unpleasant draught.
- Inform the janitor when the heating whistles or gurgles.
