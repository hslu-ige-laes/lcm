# Add Data Source
- As an example we add a csv file of a datalogger.
- The sample file includes the temperature and humidity measurements of one room.
- Later you can link your own files and also other data sources like LoRa devices or databases.


1. Navigate to `Settings > Data Sources` in the sidebar.
1. Click `Add new`
1. Set a user defined `source Name` like `tempHumFlatA`
1. Choose the sample data file `tempHum.csv` which you can find in your application folder in the subfolder `/sampleData`
1. Click `Add new data source`

The new csv file data source appears in the table.
