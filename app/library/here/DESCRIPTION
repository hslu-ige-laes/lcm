Authors@R: person("Kirill", "Müller", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "krlmlr+r@mailbox.org")
Description: Constructs paths to your project's files.
    The 'here()' function uses a reasonable heuristics to find your project's
    files, based on the current working directory at the time when the package
    is loaded. Use it as a drop-in replacement for 'file.path()', it will always
    locate the files relative to your project root.
